# Student Performance Predictor

[![Project Status: Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-success.svg)](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo)
[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict student performance based on various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, test preparation course, writing score, and reading score. The project includes data ingestion, data transformation, model training, and a Flask-based web application for making predictions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd student_performance_predictor
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How TO Run

To run the Flask web application:

1.  **Start the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or the address shown in your terminal).

    You can then input the student's details into the form and click "Predict" to see the estimated performance score.

##  Model Details
The project utilizes various regression models for student performance prediction, including `CatBoost` and `XGBoost`. The models are evaluated using appropriate regression metrics to ensure robust performance. The training process and model selection details can be found in the `2. MODEL TRAINING.ipynb` notebook.

##  üìà Future Enhancements
*   Implement a more sophisticated UI for the web application.
*   Explore additional features that might impact student performance.
*   Integrate with a database for storing predictions and user feedback.
*   Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
